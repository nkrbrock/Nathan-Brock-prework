README

This project is a basic Assassinâ€™s Creed styled hangman game. Users will first need to push a button to begin the game and can push any character a-z. users will have a limited number of attempts before they either correctly guess the word, or lose the game, at which point the game will reset. Once the user has won a game, the program will keep a visual total of the number of wins.

Additionally, after each letter is submitted as a guess, an array will contain the letters entered by the user and display them to avoid guessing the same letter twice. The creator of this application is the sole maintainer and contributer of this project.
